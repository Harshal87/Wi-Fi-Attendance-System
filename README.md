# Wi-Fi-Attendance-System
A Python-based system for automated attendance tracking using Wi-Fi. The project captures the MAC addresses of devices connected to a Wi-Fi network to mark attendance and records it in a MySQL database. It includes a web-based GUI for teachers to manage student records and view attendance reports, and students can also check their attendance.
